- > The Attendance Management System uses barcode technology for efficient student attendance tracking.
 - > The Attendance Management System is an innovative solution designed to streamline and enhance attendance tracking through three distinct modules: Admin, Teacher, and Student.
 - > The Admin module provides comprehensive control, allowing administrators to configure the system and manage user accounts.
 - > Teachers can make barcodes to take attendance, check date-wise presence, edit their profiles, generate today's attendance reports, and check student lists division-wise. 
 - > Students can quickly mark their attendance via barcode, view their attendance history regarding their attendance status. 
 - > Students can also check their monthly attendance reports and edit their profiles.
