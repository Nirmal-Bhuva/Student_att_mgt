-> The Attendance Management System uses barcode
 technology for efficient student attendance tracking.

 -> The Attendance Management System is an innovative solution designed to streamline and enhance attendance tracking through three distinct modules: Admin, Teacher, and Student.
 
 -> The Admin module provides comprehensive control, allowing administrators to configure the system and manage user accounts.
 -> Teachers can make barcodes to take attendance, check date-wise presence, edit their
 profiles, generate today's attendance reports, and check student lists division-wise.
 
 -> Students can quickly mark their attendance via barcode, view their attendance history
 regarding their attendance status. 
 
 -> Students can also check their monthly attendance reports
 and edit their profiles.
